    Sorts an array using the randomized quicksort algorithm.
    
    This implementation uses a divide-and-conquer approach with random pivot selection
    to achieve O(n log n) average time complexity. The randomization helps avoid
    worst-case scenarios that can occur with deterministic pivot selection.

        arr: List of comparable elements to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        List: A new sorted list containing all elements from the input array
        
    Time Complexity:
        - Average case: O(n log n)
        - Worst case: O(nÂ²) (rare due to randomization)
        - Space complexity: O(n) due to creating new lists
